I was really drawn to this piece of art by Scottie Chih-Chieh Huang because of the artist's ability to make the electronic dandelion look fluffy and soft. Although that seems like a very simple thing to say, I was really struck but the apparent "softness" of a technological creation of a flower. Once I started to read more about this piece of art, I learned that the Dandelion Mirror is able to measure the user's facial emotion through a camera, gathering the user's smile as nutrient that causes the virtual dandelion to grow. I found this interactive part to be so wonderful, and I wish that I could smile into the mirror to see the flower grow. I'd imagine that users have a ton of fun playing with this and are also brought a lot of joy from seeing what their smile can do.

This piece by Robert Thomas fascinated me. To interact with this piece, participants put on a headset which tracks their brain waves. The different brain waves lead to different colors and widths of the lines shown in the pictures above, and the brain waves also trigger different music. If you fully concentrate on piece, the lines turn white. I would love to interact with this piece of art, as many of the participants that were interviewed spoke about how absorbing and powerful it feels to be able to control the movement and sound with your brain.
